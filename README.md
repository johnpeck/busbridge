# Busbridge #

Busbridge works with the
[Bus Pirate](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate) to
automate communication on the SPI bus.

## First connection with Microsoft Windows ##

When you connect the Bus Pirate version 4 to Windows for the first
time, you'll need to provide [this inf file](inf/bpv4_win7_64.inf).
